# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn run dev`

Runs the proxy and UI using env variables set in .env.dev

### `yarn run prod`

Runs the proxy and UI using env variables set in .env.prod

## Notes

- Requests made to the proxy will log to console. 
- Sample .env files are in a folder called "oreid-doc1 .env files (warrick)"
- you DO NEED to have the .env file in the folder along with the other .env.dev and env.prod - even though the .env is only a template the framework checks for it's existance.
